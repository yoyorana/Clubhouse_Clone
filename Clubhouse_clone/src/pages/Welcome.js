					Hi there! üëãüèΩ Our Community Guidelines are meant to explain what is and isn‚Äôt allowed on Clubhouse. The overwhelming majority of rooms on Clubhouse happen without incident, but we want to set clear expectations of what we do not allow on the app. If you see or hear something that breaks these rules please report it to us. We may take a number of steps, including issuing a warning, removing the content, or removing someone‚Äôs account.
